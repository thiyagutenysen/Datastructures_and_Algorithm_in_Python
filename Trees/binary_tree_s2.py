# maximum number of nodes at level l is 2^l
# root level is 0 and the next level is 1 and so on
# max number of nodes in a binary tree of height h is (2^h)-1
# if a tree only has root note then it's height is 1
# if a tree has 0th and 1st level then it's height is 2
# if a binary tree has N nodes, then height = log_base_2(N+1)
# A binary tree with L leaves has at-least log_base_2(L)+1 levels
# For a full-binary tree the number of leaf nodes = (number of internal nodes with 2 children) + 1
