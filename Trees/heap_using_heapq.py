# By simply calling heap we mean array implementation of min-heap
# We are gonna implement only 2 extra methods than minheap_using_heapq.py

# Method 1 - decreaseKey(): Decreases value of key.
# The time complexity of this operation is O(Logn).
# If the decreases key value of a node is greater than the parent of the node,
# then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise,
# we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.

# Method 2 - delete(): Deleting a key also takes O(Logn) time.
# We replace the key to be deleted with minum infinite by calling decreaseKey().
# After decreaseKey(), the minus infinite value must reach root,
# so we call extractMin() to remove the key.
